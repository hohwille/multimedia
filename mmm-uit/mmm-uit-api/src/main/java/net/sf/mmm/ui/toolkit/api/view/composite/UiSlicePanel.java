/**
 * This is the interface for a slice-panel. A panel is a composite UI component that can aggregate multiple
 * other UI components. <br>
 * The aim of this approach is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>there is only one generic layout-manager</li>
 * <li>it should look and behave the same for all of the (graphical) UI implementations (esp. Swing and SWT)</li>
 * <li>it is designed to be simple to use and to understand</li>
 * <li>it is designed to satisfy the needs of predefined layouts (that you design manually) as well as dynamic
 * layouts (where components can be added and removed dynamically during runtime)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Of course there are compromises to make! The concept is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the layout can order the components only horizontal or vertical (for table structures with multiple
 * columns and rows, multiple horizontal slice-panels have to be placed in a vertical one (or vice versa)).</li>
 * <li>all components build a linear list, where horizontal layout works from the left to the right and
 * vertical layout from top to bottom.</li>
 * <li>for each component it can be specified, if the height and/or weight of the component is maximized.</li>
 * </ul>
